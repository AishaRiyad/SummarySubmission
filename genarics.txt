Generics are used to create such classes, interfaces, and methods with parameters that can operate on different data types along

Generics provide compile-time type safety that allows programmers to catch invalid types at compile time

we can write one generic method that works for any data type, and the compiler figures out the right type when you call it.

Bounded Type Parameters
we use it when we want to limit what kinds of types can be passed to a generic method or class.

A generic class declaration looks like a non-generic class declaration, except that the class name is followed by a type parameter section.
