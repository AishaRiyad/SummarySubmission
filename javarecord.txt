a record is a special kind of class introduced in Java 14 (preview) and officially added in Java 16. It is a concise way to create immutable data carrier classes, often used to model plain data with minimal boilerplate code.


A record is a final, immutable, and transparent class that automatically generates:

-Constructor
-Getters
-equals()
-hashCode()
-toString()

public record Student(String name, int age) { }
