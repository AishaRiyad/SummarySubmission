What is AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)?

AOP means Aspect-Oriented Programming ->It’s a way to add extra behavior (like logging, security, or performance tracking) 
                                        without changing your original code.


Example idea:
We want to print how long every method takes to run.

Without AOP, we’d have to write the same code inside every method manually:

long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
System.out.println(end - start);


With AOP:

@LogExecutionTime
public void doSomething() {

}
Spring will automatically add that timing logic for us in the background.
