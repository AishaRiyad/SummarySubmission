new abstract layer introduced in Java 8
process data in a declarative way similar to SQL statements.

stream is a sequence of data, like a list.
But it doesn't store the data — it pulls from a source and processes it on-the-fly.

Stream lets us apply bulk operations:
filter() → keep only matching items
map() → transform items
reduce() → combine values into one
collect() → convert stream to a list, set, etc.

Pipelining
we can chain operations because most of them return a stream.

Automatic Iterations
 don't need to write loops because the Stream API handles iteration.
names.stream()
     .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
     .forEach(System.out::println);


In java8 we can generate stream in two methods from Collection Interface :
stream() − Returns a sequential stream considering collection as its source
parallelStream() − Returns a parallel Stream considering collection as its source
