module is a collection of packages with a special file called module-info.java that defines:
What the module exports (makes accessible to other modules)
What the module requires (dependencies on other modules)

Encapsulation – Only exported packages are visible to other modules
Dependency Management – Declares which modules it depends on using require
Reliable Configuration – Detects missing or conflicting modules at compile-time
Security – Limits access to internal APIs

we can declare in metadata of the module:
-requires:which other modules our module depends on.
-exports:which packages our module makes available to other modules. Only exported packages are visible externally.
-opens:for reflection -> we can open a package (to all or to specific modules) so that runtime reflection can access internal types/members.
-uses:declares that this module consumes a service interface.
-provides:declares that this module implements/provides an implementation for a service interface.

ex:
module com.example.app {
    exports com.example.app;
}
