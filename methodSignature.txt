method signature is a unique identifier for a method. It consists of the method name and its parameter list. The method signature helps differentiate one method from another and allows the Java compiler to match method calls with their corresponding definitions.

Components of a Method Signature:
Method Name
Parameter List

Important Considerations:
Return Type
Access Modifiers
Modifiers
Exceptions
