The File class from the java.io package, allows us to work with files.

canRead()->Tests whether the file is readable or not
canWrite()->Tests whether the file is writable or not
createNewFile()->Creates an empty file
delete()->Deletes a file
exists()->Tests whether the file exists
getName()->Returns the name of the file
getAbsolutePath()->Returns the absolute pathname of the file
length()->Returns the size of the file in bytes

FileWriter - easiest choice for basic text.
BufferedWriter - better for large text files, because it is faster and supports handy features.
FileOutputStream - best for binary data (images, audio, PDFs)


Scanner - best for simple text and when you want to parse numbers or words easily.
BufferedReader - best for large text files, because it is faster and reads line by line.
FileInputStream - best for binary data (images, audio, PDFs) or when you need full control of raw bytes.
