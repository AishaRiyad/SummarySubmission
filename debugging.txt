Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in the code.

It often involves:

-Reading error messages
-Tracing variable values step by step
-Testing small pieces of code independently


The most basic (and often most effective) way to debug Java code is to use System.out.println() to print values and check the flow of the program.



Debugging with IDEs:

 -Set breakpoints to pause the program at specific lines
 -Step through code line by line
 -Inspect variable values in real time


Debugging Checklist:

 -Read the full error message
 -Check if all variables are initialized before use
 -Print variable values to trace the problem
 -Watch for off-by-one errors in loops and arrays
 -Comment out sections of code to find bugs
