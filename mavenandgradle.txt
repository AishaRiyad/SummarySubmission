Maven:

maven is an xml-based build tool and project manager 
maven is an apache open-source project 
maven default repository is -> Maven Central Repository

this repository consists of open-source components from contributors

there is a vast array of maven plugins to customize and expand the build tool's functionality

maven projects defined by project object model a.k.a pom files written in xml

the pom.xml files contain the project's dependencies , plugins , properties
and configuration data 

maven uses a declarative approach and has a predefined lifecycle



Gradle:

it building on maven concepts

it introduces as maven successor. rather than using maven's xml-based project configeration 

it introduced a domain specific language a.k.a DSL based

gradle supports maven and lvy repositories for declaring project configurations.

it was designed with multi-project builds in mind.




both maven and gradle are free and open-sourcs software distributed under the apache license 2.0.

both are highly customizable and supported by various java IDEs.

the both provide a functionality to add plugins , they possess the same directory structure and both resolve dependencies from configurable repositories.


differences:

gradle's build script is inherntly more versatile and powerful than maven's. because gradle is based on groovy programming language.

maven's is based on xml markup language.

gradle's build script is vulnerable to bugs since it's based on a programming language.

gradle implements strategies such as build cache and incremental compilations to enable fast performance.

gradle claims that it runs up to seven times faster than maven for incremental changes, and three times faster when task outputs are cached.

there are developers out there who find maven the faster of the two.

even if both support parallel execution of multi-module builds. gradle stands out for its use of incremental builds.

it achieves this by checking the status of tasks and skipping any aren't updated, resulting in shorter build times.

gradle's groovy-based build script offers more immediate flexibility than maven's xml. 

for instance, we can write plugin customizations directly into gradle's build script.


gradle is also more powerful when we want to customize build artifacts and project structure.

while maven also highly customizable, its xml-based configuration reqires a few extra steps to customize the build.

maven has been around longer than gradle.

for that reason, there are more maven plugins available, and more major vendors support maven plugins than gradle plugins.

the two build tools use different approaches to resolve dependency conflicts.

maven follows a declaration order, while gradle references a dependency tree.

choosing a java build tool is largely uup to invidual preferences and project requirements.

if we're working on large projects, gradle might perform better and faster than maven.

if we mainly handle smaller projects, the difference in maven's performance can be script easily permits cusomization if our project needs lots of bells and whistles.

maven might suffciently meet our needs if we don't mind the steps involved in adding functionalities to its xml-based script.

on top of that , gradle is known to have a steep learning curve, even for seasoned build engineers.

this learning curve worthy investmentof time and energy if you know gradle will be will be the right long-term fit for you.

however, it may be an unnecessary uphill battle to learn gradle if maven can adequately meet our needs.

also, maven's community was already established befor gradle entered the stage.

maven may better meet our needs if community support and documentation is important to us.

choosing a build tool will depend on invividual needs.

for both devops and software developers, java build tools like maven and gradle are invaluable utilities.

since both are free, consider trying both before making an informed decision.
