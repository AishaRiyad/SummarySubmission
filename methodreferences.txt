A method reference is a shorthand way to refer to a method without having to call it directly.
It’s like saying, “Use this method here,” instead of writing a full lambda expression.

They’re mostly used with functional interfaces (like Runnable, Consumer, Predicate, etc.) — interfaces that have only one abstract method.

list.forEach(System.out::println);
