ArrayList:
part of the collection framework.
present in the java.util package
provides dynamic arrays in Java	
slower than standard arrays
helpful in programs where lots of manipulation in the array is needed
can dynamically add and remove items
automatically resizes itself
supports the storage of all types of objects.
Inefficient memory utilization





LinkedList:
linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations
every element is a separate object with a data part and address part
elements are linked using pointers and addresses
element is known as a node
ease of insertions and deletions
supports the storage of all types of objects.
Manipulating LinkedList takes less time compared to ArrayList because, in a doubly-linked list, there is no concept of shifting the memory bits. 
The list is traversed and the reference link is changed.
Good memory utilization.
More memory is used
