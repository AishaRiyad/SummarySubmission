Normally in Java, we control how objects are created and connected.

For example:
Sim sim = new Jio();

Here, the code is creating the object.
We are in control.

But in Spring, the framework (IoC container) creates and manages objects for us — it decides:

-When to create them
-When to inject them into others
-When to destroy them

That’s why it’s called Inversion of Control — the control of object creation is inverted (reversed).
Instead of our controlling the object, Spring controls it.

What is a Spring IoC Container?

The IoC container is the heart of Spring.

It:
-Creates objects (called beans)
-Manages their dependencies (using Dependency Injection)
-Controls their lifecycle


There are two main types of IoC containers in Spring:

Container             Description

BeanFactory          The most basic IoC container. It provides only basic dependency injection and bean lifecycle 
                     management.

ApplicationContext   A more advanced container that extends BeanFactory and adds enterprise-level features like event 
                     handling, internationalization, and automatic bean scanning. It’s used in almost all Spring apps.
